## Basic information

Project name: Dandelion

Project initiation date ：2023-05-20 

## Overall overview of the project
At present, the best launch method of blockchain projects is airdrop, because of its ultra-low participation threshold, ultra-high launch efficiency, but at present, there are various problems in the process of implementing airdrops, such as witch attacks, etc., Dandelion project will be based on Polkadot to create a professional reusable airdrop community and launch pad, through the community combined with the blockchain economic model model, to create a set of community economic model driven reusable airdrop launch platform, Deeply bond the project party and users, deeply tap the potential of the airdrop model, maximize the benefits of all parties and minimize the cost.

- Project background/rationale/problem to be solved

    Project Background/Reason: Airdrop is one of the best project launch modes. Thanks to the ultra-low participation threshold of the airdrop launch mode, excellent projects can accumulate a lot of popularity in a short period of time, which is an excellent and market-proven model, but at present, the project party also has many problems and pain points in the process of airdrop implementation, among which the most harmful is "witch attack", each airdrop project party by setting a variety of on-chain and social platform interaction and other verification strategies to reduce the impact of "witch attack", but its effect is not ideal. The Dandelion project explores the concept of airdrop 2.0, solves this problem by building a high-viscosity airdrop community with an on-chain economic model, and can serve as a bridge for deep integration and communication between the community and the project party, completely solve the pain points of the airdrop model, and bring rich and diverse launch experience to the Polkadot ecological project, lowering the participation threshold of the Polkadot ecosystem.
    Problems to be solved: The Dandelion project is building an airdrop community parachain (exploring the 2.0 form of airdrop), building a decentralized (DAO) native community center on Polkadot, promoting the communication and conversion of different parachain users, improving the application frequency of cross-chain infrastructure (XCM), and attracting incremental users into the Polkadot ecosystem through airdrop activities, just as Polkadot connects parachains of different consensus and becomes the transportation hub of the public chain, and Dandelion uses normalized airdrops (active customizable airdrops) as a bridge, connect different parachain communities, become a transportation hub of different communities, promote the rapid flow and transformation of users in different parachain communities, reduce the promotion cost of each parachain and ecological project, increase the stickiness of Polkadot ecological users, and screen high-quality real users for each project party through a pioneering community activity system to reduce the loss caused by witch attacks. The specific problem solving is as follows:

1. Solve the problem of low conversion efficiency of users in different parachain communities, and enable users to quickly complete the process of crossing communities from 0 to 1 through the airdrop mode;

2. Break the isolated island of parachain communities, let different parachain communities have more intersection, and achieve the effect of 1 + 1 > 2;

3. Reduce the loss caused by the witch attack to the project party through customizable rule airdrop;

4. Promote users to contact with diversified Polkadot ecological projects to increase the principle of contact surface to increase user stickiness;

5. Through the reusable community airdrop launch mode, significantly reduce the promotion cost of each parachain and its ecological project;

6. Solve other problems such as users' low enthusiasm to participate in on-chain governance (through community activity rules);

7. The user conversion rate can be easily traced on the chain.

- Project description
     Dandelion project, the overall idea of the project is to dig deep into the potential of the airdrop model, explore the form of airdrop 2.0, make a professional airdrop platform that binds the community and each project party, establish a sticky community that is ready at any time, save the publicity and time cost before the project party's airdrop, and eliminate the loss of witch attacks and concentrated selling to the project party through the community economic model, so that the project party can obtain real and effective users, and also benefit real users. Greatly save the intermediate cost of project promotion, so that really good projects are easier to stand out. It also reduces the risk of fraud when users receive airdrops through centralized management. After the project is ready, it is planned to hand over to community governance and complete the process of decentralization.
- An introduction to techniques for preventing witch attacks
    Before avoiding a witch attack, we must first analyze what the essence of the witch attack is, and the prerequisite for being attacked by a witch is that the cost of creating a new witch account is lower than the airdrop revenue of each account, that is, the "airdrop income of a single witch account>The cost of new witch trumpet", airdrop projects that meet this condition will inevitably be attacked by witches, especially projects with higher popularity and more optimistic markets will be more seriously affected by witch attacks, based on this principle, Dandelion project designed a set of "customizable airdrop rules smart contract", the contract can limit the user conditions participating in the airdrop to achieve the purpose of suppressing witch attacks.

For example, the airdrop rules for a contract with custom airdrop rules are as follows:

1. Airdrops will be issued according to the number of community token pledges pledged by users;

2. A single user can stake up to 1,000 community tokens;

3. Community activity needs to be >20 (the way to obtain community activity is to interact on the community chain "watering the airdrop homepage", "on-chain governance voting", "inviting new users to join the airdrop", etc.);

4. The block height released by the airdrop starts from 20,000 blocks high to 45,000 block height.

Under the above rules, the witch attack changed from the technical threshold to the economic threshold and time threshold, and the technical advantage of scientists was weakened, we assume that a scientist wants to open more witch accounts to obtain airdrops, then the minimum cost of each witch account is to pledge 1,000 community tokens and long-term on-chain interaction, which cannot be completed when the airdrop is about to be issued, and the advance layout needs to bear the cost of market fluctuation risk and on-chain interaction. According to the rules of slow release of airdrops by blocks, short-term selling pressure and systemic risks caused by user concentrated smashing on the price of the currency can be effectively avoided, so the scale and impact of "customizable rule airdrops" on witch attacks can be effectively suppressed, so that the project team is greatly affected by witch attacks.
